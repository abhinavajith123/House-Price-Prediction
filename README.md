# House Price Prediction 

A full-stack machine learning application for predicting house prices using the **XGBoost** algorithm.  
The project uses **FastAPI** for the backend API and **React** for the frontend user interface.

---

##  Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on user-provided features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.  
A trained **XGBoost regression model** powers the predictions, exposed through a FastAPI backend and consumed by a React frontend.
